3. The collaborator introduces the information. 
4.The system validates and apresents the information to the collaborater, asking for confirmation. 
5. The collaborator confirms. 
6. The system regists the information and informs the collaborator about the sucess of the operation.


#### Extensions (or alternative fluxes)

*a. The collaborator cancels the registration

> Case of use ends.

4a. Minimal information missing.
>       1. The system informs which information is missing.
>       2. The system allows introducing the missing information (step 3)
>
        >       2a. The collaborator doesnÂ´t add information. The case of use ends.

4b. The systems detects the information (or any amount of information) introduces must be unique and already exists in the system.
>       1. The system alerts the collaborator for the fact.
>       2. The system allows the changing (step 3).
>               
        >2a. The collaborator does not change anything. The use case.

4c. The system detects the information introduced (or any amount of information) are invalid.

| Main Flow | Question: Which class... | Answer | Justification |
|:--------------  |:---------------------- |:----------|:---------------------------- |
| 1. The collaborator starts to create a new Freelancer. | ...interacts with the user? | CreateFreelancerUI | Pure Fabrication: does not justify gice this responsability in any class that exists in the MD | 
|                                                        | ...coordinates the UC? | CreateFreelancerController | Controller |
|                                                        | ...creates the instance Freelancer? | RegisterFreelancer | HC+LC + Creator |

| 2. The system asks needed information (i.e. name, level of expertise, e-mail, NIF, bank account (IBAN), address and country). |  |  |  |  
| 3. The collaborator introduces the information. | ...keeps the information? | Freelancer | IE: Knows his own information | 
|                                                 | ...generates the id for each freelancer? | Freelancer | IE: Knows his own information. |
| 4. The system validates and apresents the information to the collaborater, asking for confirmation. | ...validates the information?(local)? | Freelancer  | IE: Knows his own information |  
|                                                                                                     | ...validates the information(global)? | RegisterFreelancer | HC+LC |                                        
| 5. The collaborator confirms. |  |  |  | 
| 6. The system regists the information and informs the collaborator about the sucess of the operation. | ...keeps the freelancer created? | RegisterFreelancer | HC+LC: Plataform delegated functions  |
|                                                                                                       | ...informs the collaborator? | CreaterFreelancerUI | Pure Fabrication |


### Systematization ##

 From the racional results the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are : 
 
 * Plataform
 * Freelancer


 The other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identify:

 * CreateFreelancerUI
 * CreateFreelancerController 
 * FreelancerRecord
